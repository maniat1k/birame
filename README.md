# Birame Theme for Oh My Zsh
**Based on the popular [Bira](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/bira.zsh-theme) theme.**

The **Birame** theme enhances the original Bira by incorporating unique Unicode symbols for better visual cues and customization. This theme aims to create an aesthetically pleasing command-line experience with improved readability and a modern touch.

## Features
- Customizable prompt with Unicode symbols for home, local machine, and configurations.
- Adaptability for various terminal settings and fonts supporting Unicode.
- Enhanced visual elements to reduce visual fatigue.

## Unicode Options
Choose from several Unicode symbols to represent different prompt elements. These symbols are customizable, and you can modify them based on your preferences.

### Home Symbols
- ⌂, ⟰, 㑞

### Local Symbols
- ♎, ⚙, ⚶, ✙, ✪, ✱, ⟴, ⧁, ⨁

For more Unicode symbols, you can refer to [Alan Wood’s Unicode Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows](http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/miscellaneous_symbols_and_arrows.html).
